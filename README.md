# Agentic EDA System using LangGraph + Groq

## Overview

This project implements a **Data Science Agent** — an autonomous, state-driven system that can reason about data, plan analytical steps, execute real computations, and synthesize insights, much like a human data scientist.

Instead of a monolithic prompt-based EDA, the system decomposes data science work into **intent understanding, analytical planning, execution, and insight generation**, orchestrated via **LangGraph**.
This project implements an **Agentic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** system using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Groq LLMs**, wrapped with a **Gradio UI** for interactive usage. The system behaves like an autonomous data analyst: it interprets user intent, plans analysis steps, performs EDA programmatically, and returns structured insights.

The notebook demonstrates how **stateful agent graphs** can be used to orchestrate reasoning, tool execution, and response generation in a clean, production-aligned way.

## Key Objectives

* Enable the agent to *think in steps* like a professional data scientist
* Separate **reasoning, execution, and interpretation**
* Ensure results are grounded in **actual computation**, not hallucination
* Provide an interactive interface for non-technical users
* Build a multi-step **EDA agent** instead of a single-prompt LLM
* Use **LangGraph** to explicitly model reasoning and execution flow
* Separate **planning**, **execution**, and **response synthesis**
* Enable interactive EDA via **Gradio**

## High-Level Architecture

### Agent Execution Graph

The following diagram represents the **end-to-end agentic data science pipeline**, implemented using LangGraph. Each node corresponds to a distinct cognitive or computational responsibility, mirroring real-world data science workflows.

<img width="131" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6382419-13a7-4439-b83e-916847286d78" />

**Flow Explanation:**

* `__start__` → Entry point
* `planner` → Interprets user intent and plans steps
* `eda` → Performs exploratory data analysis
* `feature_eng` → Applies feature engineering logic
* `ml` → Trains and evaluates models
* `reflect` → Reviews model performance and decides iteration
* `response` → Produces human-readable insights
* `__end__` → Terminates execution

The dashed feedback loop between **ML ↔ Reflect** enables iterative improvement, a hallmark of senior-level and AutoML systems.

The system is built around a **state-driven agent graph**.

### Agent State

The agent maintains a shared mutable state (`AgentState`) that flows across nodes:

* `query`: User EDA request
* `intent`: Parsed analytical intent
* `plan`: Step-by-step analysis plan
* `analysis`: Computed EDA results
* `final_response`: Natural language insights

This makes the agent **transparent, debuggable, and extensible**.

## Agent Graph Flow (Conceptual Diagram)

```

   │
   ▼
[Planner Agent]
   │
   ▼
[EDA Executor]
   │
   ▼
[Insight Generator]
   │
   ▼

```

Each block is a **LangGraph node**, and edges define deterministic execution order.

---

## Core Components Explained

### 1. Intent Detection

* Uses a Pydantic schema (`IntentSchema`)
* Extracts *what kind of EDA* the user wants (summary, correlation, distribution, etc.)
* Prevents vague or unsafe analysis execution

### 2. Planner Agent

* Uses a system prompt (`PLANNER_PROMPT`)
* Converts intent into **explicit EDA steps**
* Example:

  * Load dataset
  * Inspect columns
  * Generate statistical summary
  * Identify missing values

This mirrors how a human data scientist thinks.

---

### 3. EDA Execution Agent

* Executes real Python EDA logic
* Computes:

  * Shape of dataset
  * Column types
  * Descriptive statistics
  * Missing value counts

The LLM **does not hallucinate results** — it reasons about real outputs.

---

### 4. Insight Generator

* Transforms raw statistics into **human-readable insights**
* Highlights:

  * Potential data quality issues
  * Feature distributions
  * Analytical next steps

## LangGraph Implementation Details

```text
StateGraph(AgentState)
  ├── planner_node
  ├── eda_node
  └── response_node
```

* Nodes are registered with `graph.add_node()`
* Execution order defined with `graph.add_edge()`
* Compiled into a runnable app via `graph.compile()`

This ensures:

* Deterministic flow
* No hidden chain-of-thought
* Easy debugging & logging

---

## Gradio Interface

The agent is exposed through a **production-style Gradio UI**, allowing users to interact with the Data Science Agent using natural language and a dataset path.

### UI Capabilities

* Natural language task specification (e.g., *"Train XGBoost and maximize F1 score"*)
* Dataset path input (CSV)
* One-click execution
* Structured, scrollable agent responses

This interface abstracts away code-level complexity and makes the agent usable by:

* Analysts
* ML engineers
* Non-technical stakeholders

The UI reinforces the goal of the project: **industrial-grade autonomous data science**, not notebook-bound experimentation.

The notebook exposes the agent using **Gradio**, enabling:

* Natural language EDA queries
* Instant execution feedback
* Clean UI for non-technical users

This makes the system suitable for:

* Data analysts
* Product managers
* ML engineers

---

## Example Usage

### Using the Agent Directly

**Input**:

> "Perform an exploratory data analysis on the dataset and summarize key insights"

**Output**:

* Dataset dimensions
* Feature-level statistics
* Missing value warnings
* Suggested next analysis steps

## Using the `ezyml` Package

This project integrates seamlessly with **`ezyml`**, a lightweight ML utility package that abstracts model training, evaluation, and metric optimization into simple, declarative calls.

### Why `ezyml`?

* Removes boilerplate ML code
* Standardizes training & evaluation
* Prevents LLMs from hallucinating model logic
* Makes the agent *tool-driven*, not *text-driven*

Within the agent pipeline, `ezyml` is typically invoked inside the **ML node**.

### Installation

```bash
pip install ezyml
```

### Example: Training a Classification Model

```python
from ezyml import train_classifier

results = train_classifier(
    data=df,
    target="label",
    model="xgboost",
    metric="f1",
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42
)
```

### Returned Artifacts

The `train_classifier` call returns a structured object containing:

* Trained model
* Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC scores
* Confusion matrix
* Feature importance (if supported)

These outputs are passed back into the agent state for:

* Reflection
* Iteration decisions
* Final explanation generation

### Role in the Agentic Loop

In this system:

* **Planner** decides *what model & metric to use*
* **ML node** executes training via `ezyml`
* **Reflect node** evaluates results and decides whether to retry
* **Response node** explains performance in plain English

This makes `ezyml` a **critical execution backbone** of the AutoML pathway.

---

**Input**:

> "Perform an exploratory data analysis on the dataset and summarize key insights"

**Output**:

* Dataset dimensions
* Feature-level statistics
* Missing value warnings
* Suggested next analysis steps
